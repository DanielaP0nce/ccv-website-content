title: Autonomous Empirical Research (aer)
id: aer
description: The Autonomous Empirical Research Group (AER) strives to enhance and accelerate scientific discovery by automating each step of the empirical research process, from constructing a scientific hypothesis to conducting novel experiments. CCV is supporting development of a framework which AER can use to run simulations to test machine learning models and to run experiments with real participants via crowd-sourcing platforms (e.g. MTurk, Prolific).
