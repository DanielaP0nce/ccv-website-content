title: Automated Continuos Behavioral Monitoring (ACBM)
description: Automated Continuous Behavioral Monitoring (ACBM) is a machine vision-based automated phenotyping method to detect and quantify the earliest-detected phenotypes in Tdp43Q331K knock-in mice. This method entails continuous video recording for 5 days that is then scored by a trained computer system. The system is a set of DL models deployed on google cloud platform using Kubeflow pipelines. Our goal is to establish sensitive, robust, objective, and open-source machine vision-based behavioral analysis tools that will be widely available to workers in the field.
