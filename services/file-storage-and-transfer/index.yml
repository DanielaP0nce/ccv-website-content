questions:
  - question: What is the classification of your data?
    information: |
      Brown has classified its information assets into one of four risk-based categories 
      (No Risk, Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3) for the purpose of determining who is allowed 
      to access the information and what security precautions must be taken to protect it 
      against unauthorized access. It is the data and service ownerâ€™s responsibility to ensure 
      appropriate security measures are taken depending on the risk classification. If you 
      have any questions or need help, please reach out to the Information Security Group 
      (isg@brown.edu). [Brown Data Risk Classification](https://it.brown.edu/computing-policies/risk-classifications)
