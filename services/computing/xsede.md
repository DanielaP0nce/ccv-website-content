[XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/) is an NSF-funded, nationwide collection of supercomputing systems that are available to researchers through merit-based allocations.  The resources are free, but the application process is competitive.  CCV participates in the Campus Champions program and has a small pool of compute time available for Brown researchers to try out XSEDE resources.   This is a great way to test your code on XSEDE systems before getting your own allocation.

Deadlines for research allocations are quarterly:

<div>
  <table style=" font-size:0.9rem; margin-bottom:2rem;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>SUBMISSION PERIOD</th>
        <th>MEETING DATE</th>
        <th>USERS NOTIFIED</th>
        <th>ALLOCATION BEGIN DATE</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Dec 15 thru Jan 15</td>
        <td>Early March</td>
        <td>March 15</td>
        <td>April 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mar 15 thru Apr 15</td>
        <td>Early June</td>
        <td>June 15</td>
        <td>Jul 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Jun 15 thru Jul 15</td>
        <td>Late August/Early September</td>
        <td>September 15</td>
        <td>Oct 1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sep 15 thru Oct 15</td>
        <td>Early December</td>
        <td>December 15</td>
        <td>Jan 1</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
