Studio 4 in Brown's [Granoff Center](https://arts.brown.edu/studio-4) is a flexible production space used for teaching and research. It is a fairly basic, workshop-like space that we share with Brown's [MultiMedia Labs](https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/multimedia-labs-new-site/home). The MML are inclusive, adaptive, and experimental spaces equipped with emerging technology to support creative digital work and inspire a community of makers. It has spaces for video production, podcasting, large format 2D printing, 3D printing, and VR. The CCV and MML continue to collaborate on a variety of VR projects for the Brown community, with Studio 4 serving as the home base for visualization research and exploration.

## CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment (upcoming)

Our Cave is a TAN VR-Cube, an 8' cubic room in which 3-D images are projected on 3 walls and the floor. It uses stereo depth-perception glasses by [Volfoni](http://volfoni.com/en/edge-rf/), an [OptiTrack](https://optitrack.com) motion capture system, and the [Unity](https://unity.com) game engine with a plugin from [MiddleVR](https://www.middlevr.com/2/). Positional audio is provided by a 5.1 surround sound system. Each system works in parallel, creating the illusion of virtual reality in an open space without head-mounted devices. Software packages available through the CCV include volume visualization, molecular visualization, and simple 3-D model manipulation.

The Cave is currently in a rebuilding phase as we fully integrate the system with Unity. It is available to all researchers and educators at Brown. New projects can be initiated through consultation with CCV visualization staff.
