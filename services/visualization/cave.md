The Cave is a [TAN VR-Cube](http://www.barco.com/en/products-solutions/cubic-immersive-virtual-environment.aspx), an 8' cubic room in which 3-D images are projected on the walls and the floor. CrystalEyes LCD-shutter glasses provide stereo depth-perception, and a variety of Intersense and Polhemus tracking devices allow software to track the user's position. The Cave also has a multi-speaker sound system that provides positional audio. Software packages available through CCV allow the Cave to be used for a variety of purposed, including volume visualization, molecular visualization, and simple 3-D model manipulation.

The Cave is available to all researchers and educators at Brown. New projects can be initiated through consultation with CCV visualization staff.

<!-- Note from Leo:
    The Multimedia Labs provide the Brown community with inclusive, adaptive, and experimental 
    spaces equipped with emerging technology to support creative digital work and inspire a 
    community of makers. We embrace thinking through making as a powerful approach to design and 
    learning. Some of the activities the MML supports include: video production, podcasting, large 
    format 2D printing, 3D printing, and VR.
