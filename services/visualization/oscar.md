[Oscar](/services/computing#high-performance-computing-(oscar)) offers a modern and robust alternative for displaying datasets that are too computationally expensive for laptops and desktops. For instance, our team supports using the open source software Paraview, to render datasets in a distributed way using Oscar.  You can learn learn more about this service in our [documentation](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar/visualization/paraview-remote-rendering).
